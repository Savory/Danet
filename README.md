## Description

Danet is a framework heavily inspired by a NodeJS Framework called
[Nest](https://docs.nestjs.com/). We aim to provide the same efficiency, but in
[Deno](https://deno.land/). Of course, Nest is way more mature, think of it as a
hero that we look up to.

We borrow a lot from it, including documentation and sentences on this page, so
please, definitely check it out because they deserve a lot of credit. Without
Nest, we wouldn't be developing Danet.

Danet is a framework for building efficient, scalable Deno server-side
applications. It is entirely build with Typescript.

Under the hood, Danet makes use of [Oak](https://github.com/oakserver/oak). We
might support other HTTP Web Framework in the future !

We abstract a lot of things so you can focus on your core business and
architecture.

## Philosophy

Deno is a relatively new engine. Nest was one of the greatest framework to
improve the architecture of NodeJS project. We want to bring the same level of
pro-efficiency and professionalism into Deno's world.

Exactly like Nest, Danet provides an out-of-the-box application architecture
which allows developers and teams to create highly testable, scalable, loosely
coupled, and easily maintainable applications.

The architecture is the same as our hero, and it was originally heavily inspired
by Angular.
