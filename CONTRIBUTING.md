# Contributing to Danet

ðŸ¤Ÿ Thanks for coming here and contributing to Danet ðŸ¤Ÿ

## How do I contribute :

- Create an issue for bug or feature request
- Comment an existing issue to say that you are tackling it
- Join [our discord](https://discord.gg/Q7ZHuDPgjA)

## I don't know where to start

Look for issues with 'good first issue'. If there is none but you are willing to
contribute, hop on discord to talk about what can be done on the project. There
is always things to do !

### I am new to programming/typescript, I'm afraid to make mistake

Do not worry. We all had to learn at some point. The best thing you can do it
pick an issue and give it a try.

If you feel lost or don't know what to do or how to do something, come on our
discord and we will guide you. We might even do pair programming together !
